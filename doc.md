I'll help you create a well-structured Spring Boot project that follows domain-driven design (DDD) principles and can be easily transformed into microservices later.



I've created a modular Spring Boot project structure that follows domain-driven design principles and can be easily converted to microservices. Here are the key aspects of the design:

1. Project Structure:
   - Common module: Shared utilities, DTOs, and exceptions
   - Product domain: Everything related to products
   - Order domain: Everything related to orders
   - Application: Main application module that ties everything together

2. Key Features:
   - Modular architecture with clear boundaries
   - Domain-driven design principles
   - Maven multi-module setup
   - Spring Boot 3.x with Java 17
   - JPA for persistence
   - RESTful APIs
   - Lombok for reducing boilerplate

3. Loose Coupling:
   - Each domain module is independent
   - Communication between domains via interfaces/DTOs
   - Shared code in common module
   - Clear separation of concerns

To convert this to microservices later:

1. Each domain module can become its own microservice
2. Add service discovery (Eureka)
3. Add API gateway
4. Implement distributed tracing
5. Add circuit breakers
6. Convert to event-driven architecture using message queues

Would you like me to add any specific domain logic or expand any particular part of the structure?
